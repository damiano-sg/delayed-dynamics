The effect of Delayed Dynamics on the Stability of Ecosystems


This should answer a short list of basic questions:

    *What is this repo or project? (You can reuse the repo description you used earlier because this section doesnâ€™t have to be long.)
    *How does it work?
    *Who will use this repo or project?
    *What is the goal of this project?

You likely have the answer to many of these questions in your head and have discussed them with your team. It's helpful to write them down for people who find your repository. Not only will it be easier for developers to know how to fork the project or become involved with the project, but it will be easy for non-coders to understand what the code is designed to do, and how they, too, can become involved.
