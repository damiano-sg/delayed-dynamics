**Title of my Master thesis:** The effect of Delayed Dynamics on the Stability of Ecosystems. _add link_

**Abstract:**
Differential Equations and random matrix theory have found applications in many fields, ranging from physics, number theory and ecology. Fifty years ago, in a seminal article entitled "Will a Large Complex System be Stable?", Robert May showed that increasingly large or complex ecological networks have negligibly small probability to be stable. However, from field studies in ecology experimental evidences point on the opposite direction: large and complex ecosystems seem to be stable. This apparent contradiction is known as the Complexity-Stability paradox. May and other scientists analyzed large networks in which species interact at random and studied analytically the asymptotic stability of such systems as a function of the number of species and the number of interactions through the use of random matrix theory.
My master thesis is aimed to critically review these results and show how the introduction of delay in ecosystem population dynamics may have a strong impact
on ecosystem dynamics and change important aspects of the Complexity-Stability paradox.

This should answer a short list of basic questions:
* What is this repo or project? (You can reuse the repo description you used earlier because this section doesnâ€™t have to be long.)
* How does it work?
* Who will use this repo or project?
* What is the goal of this project?

You likely have the answer to many of these questions in your head and have discussed them with your team. It's helpful to write them down for people who find your repository. Not only will it be easier for developers to know how to fork the project or become involved with the project, but it will be easy for non-coders to understand what the code is designed to do, and how they, too, can become involved.
